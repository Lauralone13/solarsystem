Exercise 61 [Laura]
(method structure, if-else, loops, reading/parsing File, scanner interaction, experiment and play, formatting Strings, ..)
[rating for me: 3,5 (of 5)]

A Solar System Project 2: (FollowUp Exercise - continue with the classes youâ€™ve made in Exercise 58, or make new^^)

A nice colleague of yours saw you writing on the program and asked you if you could help him. 
"My kids are always bothering me with silly questions when I come home from work, and if I say I'm tired or that I just don't know, they come up with fantasy stories and speculations of planets and everything, I couldn't even think of if I would be high as hell. It would be great to have a program, to be able to quickly research something about the solar system, and have something truthful and interesting to tell them, by just entering one word."

[This is just a suggestion of how I managed it. If you think there is a much nicer or easier way to get to a related output, go ahead ;) - don't be too hard on yourself, if it's motivating to improve (and keep on practising) with a easier version of this exercise, it's totally okay^^]

a) a class "MainPartsOfSolarSystem", with the method 'getMainParts', which prints the main parts of the solar system, like down below, at the end of the sample interaction.

b) a class 'WordsToKnow' with the properties 'word' and 'description', and getters.

c) download the textfile called "wordstoknow_solarsystem.txt" here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gXNNxX8wqDfiim7fdGo5u0u6J71tYzD1?usp=sharing 

d) a method that prints all searchable words as a list of Strings

e) a method that receives a String, and returns a list of WordsToKnow, if the word(not the description) contains the received String.

f) a class "SolarSystemDataViewer", where you put all the printing methods, to mix them or leave separate, and to call them later in the next class

g) a class "SolarSystemResearcher", where the interaction takes place, that you see below in the example output.
[meaning for example: 
-you enter 'star', then you should get all the data for this object (like in the first exercise, nice formatted), 
-below this you should see how many results are counted for that input, 
-and after That, if a WordToKnow-word(not description) exists that contains the given input, the word and the description should be printed also after the result(like below - shortened).
-If you enter 'index', you should get a list of all the words you could search for.
-If you enter a wrong word, you can also choose if you want to see the index of searchable words.
-make it as bulletproof as possible
-and if you enter 'stop', the program stops like below, and prints the main-parts of the solar system.]

h) an Application, where you just call the SolarSystemResearcher, and start researching.
